  Meditation timer
</h1>

This is a simple browser based timer to help visualise the timing for correct breathing for 2 common patterns: the one minute breath and the complete breath

Future development will feature more patterns, and the ability for a user to customise the length of some of the timers plus options to change the colour scheme if desired. This is the MVP
